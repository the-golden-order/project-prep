# Group Project: Begin Wireframes & Software Requirements

## Wireframes

It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project.

The next step for group projects is to begin to generate wireframes for each page in your application.

## Tasks
Wireframes allow you to experiment with the look and feel of a website without committing any code.  
Create your wireframe in a digital tool. Whiteboard wireframes will not be accepted.

Provide an image of your wireframes in the readme of your project.

## User Stories

Start out by creating at least 5 user stories for your approved project. The outline/requirements for user stories can be found HERE

*Each story in your project management board should contain:*

* Title
* User Story sentence
* Feature Tasks
* Acceptance Tests
* Provide a link to your project management board that contains your user stories in your project Readme.

## Software Requirements

Using the Software Requirements Document, create a new file within your main GH repo named requirements.md.  
Include in this doc the required information for your software reqs for your project as a whole.

## Domain Modeling

Draw out the entities for your project and how they are related to each other.  
Determine the relationships between the functions/methods and entities of your app.

Include in your domain model the names and data types of your entities and their properties.

Do some research on domain modeling and create your own diagram that represents your app. Here are some helpful resources as a starting point:

* Brief introduction to Domain Modeling
* Domain Modeling
* Domain driven architecture diagram
* Include this domain model in the README.md file located in your project’s GitHub repo.

## Using a Database? Make an Database Schema Diagram

If you are using a database of any kind in your project, draft out what your schema will look like by creating a diagram of all your application data models, each in it’s own collection (or table).

Be sure to identify the relationships (if any) between each of your data models:

* Does a single item in your database “belong to” just one other item in your database? For example, a person has one passport, and a passport belongs to a single person.
* Does a item in your database “belong to” multiple other items in your database? For example, a house has many residents, and each resident has one primary house.
D* o many items in your database relate to many other items in your database? For example, a band has many musicians, and a musician can be in many bands.
* Also, include for each seperate collection:

      1 .The name of each property stored in the collection.
      2. The required data type.
      3. An indication if this collection is associated with another collection.

Include this diagram in your readme, accompanied by an explanation of each data model and it’s responsibility in the application.
