# Prepare for Projects

For this project, you will be summarizing all of the concepts you’ve learned and applied in labs up to this point of the course.  
Your instructional team will provide you with further specification regarding constraints and expectations for course-specific requirements.

At this point, you should have an idea as to what’s possible to create given what your course has covered so far and will cover before the start of the project.  
Use that knowledge to generate some ideas and discussion!

## Project Requirements

Your instructor will provide the detailed requirements for your project, and team tasks.

## Group Project: Pitch Ideas

It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project.  
You’ve been given groups, so the first step for group projects is to pitch ideas.

## Tasks

As a group, arrange a 30-60 minute time when you can all be in the same place.  
Lab time is ideal for this.

There will be two phases for this:
* brainstorm ideas
* pitching projects

### Brainstorming Ideas

* Grab a whiteboard and brainstorm ideas.  
* During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas.  
* Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases.  
* If an explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

### Pitching a Project

Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, the person who offered the idea will give a pitch.  
Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes.  
The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your group mates.  
During this phase, questions may be asked, but the discussion should be limited.  
Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch, you should have formed a short list of favorites.

## Create your Pitch

Once your team had decided on 1 or 3 favorites, prepare your pitches for submission.

Each pitch should contain the following information:
