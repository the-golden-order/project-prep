# Group Project: Team Agreement
The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable
Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

##  Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

### Describe at least:

#### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
  * Roger: CSS, React-kind of,
  * Thomas: backend and data stuff
  * Ryan: Gitflow, git-ar
  * Marcus: Pro-mountain walker, public speaking, good dad, works hard at front end
  * Eden: CSS (Rainbows :)) backend, organization 
#### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
  * It seems like we have a pretty good array of skills, with a little lacking in front end, so we just need to have a well structured plan in that area and our teamwork will make the dreamwork :D
#### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  * Roger: functions, the patterns of the functions and set up.
  * Thomas: Nested Components
  * Ryan: Front end
  * Marcus: Front and Backend
  * Eden: Front end 
#### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
 * We'll spend a good portion at the start making a plan on what others will do and reviewing the previous work and what needs to do be done. We can set up github projects cards, or lucid cards. We'll have a morning meeting to touch base and make sure no one has any blockers stopping them from continuing. 

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

### Describe at least:

#### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  * Just talk it out between us, take a vote. Democratic process. Bring in a third party if it gets too bad
#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  * Just talk it out between us, take a vote. Democratic process.

#### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  * Paired Programming 

#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  * Approach them and ask what's blocking them, how can we help get them up to speed so they can start to contribute
#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  * Tactfully and with psychological safeness, then bring in a third party mediator 


## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

### Describe at least:

#### What hours will you be available to communicate?
  * 9-6, if necessary maybe later but no later than 8.
#### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  * Slack, remo
#### How often will you take breaks?
  * As necessary, ideally 10 minutes every hour.
#### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  * Lower the MVP, start to use the extra hours (as necessary)
#### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  * Slack
#### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  * Talk loud, yell as necessary
#### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  * Ask if everyone feels safe, initiate one-on-one conversations as needed

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty”(weird verbage but go off) problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

### Describe at least:

#### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  * Github projects, once we get a plan going we can allocate tasks to each member
#### What project management tool will be used?
  * Lucid Chart

## Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.
WE DONE IT
### Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

* Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
* When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
* Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone” :)

## Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

### Describe at least:

#### What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  * All of Them
#### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  * We are the-golden-order organization on github, we'll ACP from our local machines to a repo in this organization. 
#### What is your Git flow?
  * Pull, Add, Commit, Push, Pull

### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider: 
  * yes
#### How many people must review a PR?
  * At least 2
#### Who merges PRs?
  * The two people who are approving
#### How often will you merge?
  * Whenever necessary (component complete)
#### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  * Slack, or Remo depending on where members are
